# Project-6.1 Sports Accounting
### By NHL Stenden Student Team IT2C for Quintor

<h3> Description </h3>
A small desktop application that allows sports assocations to keep track and manage their finances. Sports Accounting is capable of reading MT-940 bank files (.sta) to save and manipulate bank trsanction data locally. The application features a NoSQL MongoDB database for archival storage of the files as well as a PostgreSQL database for manipulating the transactions. 
Sport assocation owners can link transactions to a Bar category or to one of the registered assocation Members.
The application was built with Python and TKinter utilizing Flask to create the API responsible for connecting the app to the two databases.
